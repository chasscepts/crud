# CRUD

> CRUD is an API testing web application. It exposes all the CRUD request methods - get, post, update and delete. The request headers are also exposed, and users can edit them as they wish. All responses are in JSON format, and CRUD provides a nice JsonViewer to display the Response. The response header is also available in JSON format, so also is the error, if any. Developed with react and redux, CRUD provides a slim and user-friendly UI which makes it stand out from command-line tools that provide similar functionalities.
